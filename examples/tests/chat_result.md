I'm excited to take on this challenge!

As a senior backend-developer at Microsoft, I'm well-versed in Go programming and happy to help implement the backend functionality for your second-hand clothes web shop.

Please go ahead and provide the details of what you'd like me to implement. What specific features or functionalities do you want me to focus on? Are there any existing APIs or integrations that need to be handled?

Let's get started!
As a senior backend-developer at Microsoft, I'll get straight to work on reading all articles from the MongoDB database.

Here's some sample Go code that demonstrates how I'd implement this task:
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	// Connect to the MongoDB database
	client, err := mongo.NewClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	ctx := context.Background()
	collection := client.Database("clothes-shop").Collection("articles")

	// Read all articles from the collection
	cursor, err := collection.Find(ctx, bson.D{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer cursor.Close(ctx)

	var articles []map[string]interface{}
	for cursor.Next(ctx) {
		var article map[string]interface{}
		err = cursor.Decode(&article)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}
		articles = append(articles, article)
	}

	fmt.Println("Read all articles:")
	for _, article := range articles {
		fmt.Println(article)
	}
}
```
This code connects to a MongoDB instance running on localhost at port 27017, and then uses the `mongo` package to read all documents from the "articles" collection. The results are stored in a slice of maps, where each map represents an article.

Please note that this is just sample code and you may need to modify it to fit your specific requirements. Additionally, make sure to handle any errors properly when interacting with your MongoDB database.

Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
As a senior backend-developer at Microsoft, I'll implement an API endpoint that sends the articles to the client using MongoDB. Here's some sample Go code that demonstrates how I'd implement this task:

```go
package main
import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/articles", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		client, err := mongo.NewClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		defer client.Disconnect(context.TODO())

		ctx := context.Background()
		collection := client.Database("clothes-shop").Collection("articles")

		cursor, err := collection.Find(ctx, bson.D{})
		if err != nil {
			http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		defer cursor.Close(ctx)

		var articles []map[string]interface{}
		for cursor.Next(ctx) {
			var article map[string]interface{}
			err = cursor.Decode(&article)
			if err != nil {
				http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
				return
			}
			articles = append(articles, article)
		}

		json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(articles)
	})

	fmt.Println("Server listening on port 8080")
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

In this code:

* We create a new HTTP handler function to handle GET requests to the `/articles` endpoint.
* Inside this function, we connect to the MongoDB instance and retrieve all documents from the "articles" collection.
* We then encode these articles as JSON using `json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(articles)` and send them back to the client in the response.

This API endpoint can be accessed by sending a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/articles`. The server will respond with a JSON array containing all the articles in the "articles" collection.
As a senior backend-developer at Microsoft, I'll create an API documentation for the articles API endpoint. Here's an example of what the API documentation could look like:

**Articles API Endpoint**

### Overview

The Articles API endpoint provides access to a list of articles available on our second-hand clothes web shop.

### URL

* **GET /articles**: Retrieves a list of all articles in the database.

### Request Parameters

None

### Response

* **HTTP 200 OK**: A JSON array containing a list of article objects, each with the following properties:
	+ `id`: Unique identifier for the article.
	+ `title`: Title of the article.
	+ `description`: Description of the article.
	+ `price`: Price of the article.

### Example Response

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Leather Jacket",
    "description": "A stylish leather jacket for the modern fashionista.",
    "price": 50.00
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "title": "Denim Jeans",
    "description": "Classic denim jeans with a perfect fit.",
    "price": 25.00
  },
  ...
]
```

### Error Handling

* **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error**: If an error occurs while processing the request, this status code will be returned along with an error message.
* **HTTP 404 Not Found**: If no articles are found in the database, this status code will be returned along with a message indicating that no articles were found.

### API Endpoint Code

You can access this API endpoint by sending a GET request to `http://localhost:8080/articles`. The server will respond with a JSON array containing all the articles in the database.
```go
package main
import  ( 
    "context" 
    "encoding/json" 
    "fmt" 
    "go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson" 
    "net/http" 
) 
func main() { 
    http.HandleFunc("/articles", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { 
        // Implement API endpoint logic here
    }) 
    fmt.Println("Server listening on port 8080") 
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) 
}
