What an exciting task!

Let me summarize my thoughts:

**Define the problem**: We're trying to retrieve articles.

**Determine the endpoint URL**: I suggest "/articles" as a suitable URL.

**Choose an HTTP method**: Given we're retrieving data, I recommend using GET.

**Select response format**: JSON is a popular choice for API responses, so let's go with that.

**Consider authentication/authorization**: Since this is just a simple retrieval of articles, I think we can skip authentication and authorization mechanisms for now. However, if there are specific requirements or constraints, we may need to implement something like OAuth or JWT tokens later on.

Here are the agents I'd like to involve:

1. **Sabrina**: As a database engineer, she would be an excellent help in designing the database schema and ensuring that our data is properly stored and retrieved.
2. **Mark**: As the project manager, Mark can assist me in defining the requirements and ensuring that our endpoint meets the necessary standards.

So, the agents I'd like to involve are:

1. Sabrina (database engineer)
2. Mark (project manager)

What do you think?
