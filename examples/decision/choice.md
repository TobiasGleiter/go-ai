Excellent breakdown of the task, my friend! As Tobi, I'm happy to confirm that our decisions align well with each other.

**Endpoint URL**: Yes, `/articles` is a clear and concise choice.

**HTTP Method**: Absolutely right again! `GET` makes perfect sense for retrieving a list of articles without modifying any data.

**Response Format**: Agreed! JSON is the way to go for consistency across our APIs.

**Authentication/Authorization**: I concur that we don't require authentication or authorization mechanisms like API keys, OAuth2, or JWT for now. However, as you mentioned, it's essential to consider adding these features in the future if necessary.

Considering these criteria, my final decision is:

• **Endpoint URL**: `GET /articles`
• **HTTP Method**: `GET`
• **Response Format**: JSON
• **Authentication/Authorization**: No authentication or authorization required for now

I'm confident that this combination of choices will result in a well-designed API endpoint. If any unforeseen circumstances arise, we can always revisit and adjust these decisions as needed.

Now that we have our high-level design settled, let's start implementing the API endpoint in Golang!
