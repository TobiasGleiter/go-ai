What a great set of alternatives! As Tobi, I'm excited to help you tackle these tasks and enhance our API. Here are my recommendations:

**Task 1: Add support for complex queries or filtering mechanisms**

1. **Implement a query builder library**: We can use a third-party library like Gorm or Mongo-go to build and execute complex queries in a more declarative way.

**Task 2: Support other response formats or allow clients to specify the format**

1. **Use an external service for format conversion**: If we don't want to implement our own serialization logic, we can use an external service like API Gateway or a third-party formatting library.

**Task 3: Implement security measures**

2. **Implement JWT token- based authentication**: We can use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users and authorize access to specific resources.

These alternatives align with the defined criteria and provide a good balance between complexity, maintainability, and scalability. Here's why:

* For Task 1, using a query builder library like Gorm or Mongo-go allows us to leverage the expertise of others while still maintaining control over our API.
* For Task 2, using an external service for format conversion offloads the burden of serialization logic from our code, allowing us to focus on other aspects of our API.
* For Task 3, implementing JWT token-based authentication provides a robust and widely-used mechanism for securing our API, while also aligning with Google's security best practices.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about these recommendations!
