What's up, folks! Tobi here, a senior backend-developer at Google, and I'm excited to tackle this challenge with you!

**Problem:** Fetch all articles from MongoDB database.

**Recognition:** To solve this problem, we need to decide which fields and conditions (if any) are required to fetch all the necessary article data from the MongoDB database.

**High-Level Steps:**

1. **Identify the Article Model**: Define what an article consists of. Is it a JSON object with specific keys like `title`, `content`, and `author`? Or is it a more complex document with nested structures?
2. **Determine the Fetch Criteria**: Are there any conditions we need to apply when fetching articles, such as filtering by date, author, or category?
3. **Specify the Fields to Return**: Which specific fields from each article do we want to retrieve? Do we need to include metadata like timestamps or creator information?
4. **Design the Query**: Based on our findings, craft a MongoDB query that fetches all articles with the required fields and conditions.

That's it for now! Let me know if you'd like me to dive deeper into the details of designing the query.
