As Tobi, I'll break down the task into high-level steps:

**Problem:** Retrieve a list of articles from our database for an external API consumer.

**Decision Steps:**

1. **Endpoint URL**: Decide on a suitable endpoint URL that makes sense for this API endpoint. For example, "/articles" seems like a good choice.
2. **HTTP Method**: Determine the most appropriate HTTP method for this endpoint. In this case, I think GET is a good fit since we're retrieving a list of articles and not modifying any data.
3. **Response Format**: Decide on the expected response format. Since we're working with JSON at Google, let's stick with that.
4. **Authentication/Authorization**: Determine if any authentication or authorization mechanisms are necessary for this endpoint. We might need to implement API keys, OAuth2, or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) depending on our requirements.

That's it! These high-level steps should give us a good foundation for designing this API endpoint.
