Another exciting task at Google!

To decide on a suitable endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format, and authentication mechanism for our current Todo, I'll follow these high-level steps:

1. **Define the problem**: Identify what we're trying to achieve with this endpoint. In this case, it seems like we want to retrieve articles.
2. **Determine the endpoint URL**: Decide on a suitable URL that reflects the functionality of the endpoint. For example, if we're retrieving a list of articles, "/articles" could be a good choice. If we're retrieving a specific article, perhaps "/articles/{id}" would be more fitting.
3. **Choose an HTTP method**: Based on the problem definition and endpoint URL, determine which HTTP method is most suitable. In this case, since we're retrieving data, I'd opt for GET.
4. **Select response format**: Since JSON is a popular choice for API responses, let's go with that as our response format.
5. **Consider authentication/authorization**: Depending on the requirements of our Todo, we may need to implement authentication or authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access this endpoint. This could include OAuth, JWT tokens, or other methods.

These are my initial thoughts. Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these steps!
