I love your enthusiasm for a systematic approach! Let's break down each point and identify some potential alternatives.

**1. Define the problem**: We want to design an endpoint to retrieve articles. To further clarify, let's consider the following:

* Pagination: Should we support pagination (e.g., pages, limit) in our endpoint?
* Filtering: Can we filter articles by specific criteria (e.g., category, date range)?
* Searching: Do we need to implement searching functionality?

**2. Determine the endpoint URL**: We've already discussed some possible options:

* `/articles`
* `/articles/{id}`
* `/search/articles`

Let's also consider the following alternatives:

* `/articles/list` for retrieving a list of articles
* `/articles/latest` for retrieving the latest articles
* `/articles/topstories` for retrieving top stories

**3. Choose an HTTP method**: We've already decided on `GET` as the primary method, but let's explore some additional options:

* `POST`: Could we use this method for creating new articles or submitting search queries?
* `PUT/DELETE`: Are there specific scenarios where updating or deleting articles might be necessary?

**4. Select response format**: JSON is a popular choice, but let's consider the following alternatives:

* XML: Is there a need to support XML as an alternative response format?
* CSV: Could we provide a CSV response for specific use cases (e.g., data imports)?
* Custom formats: Are there any custom formats required by our stakeholders or partners?

**5. Consider authentication/authorization**: We've already discussed some existing solutions within Google's ecosystem:

* OAuth
* JWT tokens

Let's also consider the following alternatives:

* Basic Auth: Could we use a simple username/password combination for authentication?
* API keys: Are there specific scenarios where API keys might be necessary?

**Additional tasks**:

* Research any specific requirements or constraints related to the endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format, or authentication mechanism.
* Verify that our choices comply with existing APIs or endpoints within Google's ecosystem.

By considering these alternatives and potential edge cases, we can refine our approach and ensure a robust solution for retrieving articles.
