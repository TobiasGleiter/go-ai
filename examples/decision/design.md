As Tobi, I'm excited to help you tackle these tasks and enhance our API. Here are some alternative approaches for each task:

**Task 1: Add support for complex queries or filtering mechanisms**

1. **Use MongoDB's built-in query language**: Instead of using Go's MongoDB driver, we can leverage MongoDB's own query language (e.g., aggregation framework) to create more complex queries.
2. **Implement a query builder library**: We can use a third-party library like Gorm or Mongo-go to build and execute complex queries in a more declarative way.
3. **Create a custom query parsing mechanism**: If we want to maintain full control over the query execution, we can implement our own parser for complex queries and generate MongoDB commands programmatically.

**Task 2: Support other response formats or allow clients to specify the format**

1. **Use Go's built-in encoding libraries**: We can utilize Go's standard library packages like `encoding/xml` and `encoding/csv` to serialize data into different formats.
2. **Implement a serialization framework**: Libraries like go-serializers or json-xml-serializer can help us convert data between different formats.
3. **Use an external service for format conversion**: If we don't want to implement our own serialization logic, we can use an external service like API Gateway or a third-party formatting library.

**Task 3: Implement security measures**

1. **Use Google's authentication and authorization services**: As part of the Google ecosystem, we can leverage Google's authentication and authorization services (e.g., OAuth2) to secure our API.
2. **Implement JWT token-based authentication**: We can use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users and authorize access to specific resources.
3. **Use a third-party authentication library**: Libraries like Go-Auth or Gauth can help us implement authentication and authorization mechanisms in our API.

These alternative approaches offer different ways to tackle each task, allowing us to choose the best solution for our specific use case. What do you think?
