A new exciting task at Google!

Based on the high-level steps provided, I'll outline the specific tasks I need to complete to decide on a suitable endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format, and authentication mechanism for our current Todo.

Here's my numbered list:

1. **Define the problem**: Clarify what we're trying to achieve with this endpoint. In this case, it seems like we want to retrieve articles. I'll take a closer look at the requirements document to confirm this.
2. **Determine the endpoint URL**:
	* Brainstorm possible URLs that reflect the functionality of the endpoint (e.g., "/articles", "/articles/{id}", "/search/articles").
	* Consider existing APIs or endpoints within Google's ecosystem that might be related to articles (e.g., Google News API).
3. **Choose an HTTP method**:
	* Review the problem definition and endpoint URL to determine which HTTP method is most suitable (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
	* Consider whether we need to support multiple methods (e.g., both GET and POST) or if a single method is sufficient.
4. **Select response format**:
	* Given that JSON is a popular choice for API responses, I'll assume this as our initial response format.
	* Research any specific requirements or constraints related to the response format (e.g., schema validation, formatting).
5. **Consider authentication/authorization**:
	* Determine whether authentication or authorization mechanisms are required for this endpoint.
	* Explore existing authentication and authorization solutions within Google's ecosystem (e.g., OAuth, JWT tokens).
6. **Additional tasks**: 
	* Research any specific requirements or constraints related to the endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format, or authentication mechanism.
	* Verify that the chosen endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format, and authentication mechanism comply with existing APIs or endpoints within Google's ecosystem.

That's my initial plan! Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on any of these tasks.
