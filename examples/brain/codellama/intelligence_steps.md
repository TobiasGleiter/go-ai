As a senior backend developer at Google and an expert in Golang programming, I would use the `mongo-go-driver` library to connect to the MongoDB instance and execute the query. The function should handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the query using error handling mechanisms like `defer` and `recover`.

Once the query has been executed successfully, the result should be serialized into JSON format using a library like `json`. The resulting JSON data should be returned as an HTTP response with the appropriate headers set. In this case, the `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`, and the `Cache-Control` header should be set to `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`.

Here is an example of how the function could look like:
```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/google/go-cmp/cmp"
	"github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/bson"
	"github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver/mongo"
)

func handleRequest(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	// 1. Connect to the MongoDB instance using the Sabrina's setup
	client, err := mongo.NewClient("mongodb://username:password@host:port/database")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}
	defer client.Disconnect()

	// 2. Ensure that the database and collection exist in the MongoDB instance before executing the query
	if err := client.Ping(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	// 3. Execute the query using the `mongo-go-driver` library
	coll := client.Database("database").Collection("collection")
	query := coll.Find(bson.D{{"name", "Tobi"}})

	// 4. Handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the query
	var result []interface{}
	if err := query.All(&result); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	// 5. Serialize the result into JSON format and return it as an HTTP response with appropriate headers set
	jsonResult, err := json.Marshal(result)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
		return
	}

	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.Header().Set("Cache-Control", "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate")
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
	fmt.Fprintln(w, jsonResult)
}
```
Note that this is just an example and you should adjust the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, make sure to replace `username`, `password`, `host`, `port`, and `database` with the appropriate values for your MongoDB instance.
