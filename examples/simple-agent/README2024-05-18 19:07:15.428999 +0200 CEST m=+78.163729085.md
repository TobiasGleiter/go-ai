As Tobi, here's my plan for implementing the API endpoint:

1. **Review Requirements**: Review the task requirements and ensure I understand what is needed - in this case, creating an API endpoint to read all articles from the MongoDB database.

2. **Set up Development Environment**: Set up a local development environment on my machine, including GoLand or Visual Studio Code, and the necessary dependencies for the project (e.g., `go get.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo`).

3. **Design API Endpoint**: Design the API endpoint to read all articles from the MongoDB database. This includes deciding on the endpoint URL, HTTP method, response format (e.g., JSON), and any authentication or authorization requirements.

4. **Create API Handler Function**: Write a Go function that will handle the API request and interact with the MongoDB database. This function should:
	* Connect to the MongoDB instance using the `mongo` package
	* Use the `Find()` method to retrieve all articles from the database
	* Marshal the article data into JSON format for the response

5. **Implement API Endpoint in Go Server**: Implement the API endpoint within a Go server framework (e.g., Gin or Revel). This will involve defining a new route for the API endpoint and mapping it to the API handler function.

6. **Test the API Endpoint**: Test the API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL to ensure that:
	* The endpoint is properly configured
	* The correct articles are returned in the response
	* Any error handling is working as expected

7. **Integrate with Existing Codebase (if applicable)**: If this API endpoint needs to be integrated with an existing codebase, I will review and modify the necessary code to ensure seamless integration.

8. **Code Review and Testing**: Perform a code review to ensure the API endpoint meets all requirements and is properly tested.
Review Requirements
Set up Development Environment
Design API Endpoint
Create API Handler Function
Implement API Endpoint in Go Server
Test the API Endpoint
Integrate with Existing Codebase (if applicable)
Code Review and Testing
Here's the output of reviewing requirements:

**Task:** Create an API endpoint to read all articles from a MongoDB database.

**Endpoint URL:** [To be determined]

**HTTP Method:** GET

**Response Format:** JSON

**Authentication/Authorization:** [To be determined]
Here is the output of reviewing requirements:

Authentication/Authorization: [To be determined]

Now, let's move on to setting up the development environment. I will install GoLand or Visual Studio Code and the necessary dependencies for the project.

It seems like you're planning to implement an API endpoint in Go to read all articles from a MongoDB database. Your plan includes:

1. Reviewing requirements
2. Setting up a development environment with GoLand or Visual Studio Code and necessary dependencies
3. Designing the API endpoint, including its URL, HTTP method, response format (JSON), and authentication/authorization requirements
4. Creating an API handler function to interact with the MongoDB database
5. Implementing the API endpoint in a Go server framework (e.g., Gin or Revel)
6. Testing the API endpoint using tools like Postman or cURL
7. Integrating the API endpoint with existing codebase, if necessary
8. Performing code review and testing

You've already reviewed the requirements and set up the development environment. Now, you're ready to move on to designing the API endpoint.

Remember to consider factors like authentication/authorization, error handling, and response format when designing your API endpoint. Good luck!
